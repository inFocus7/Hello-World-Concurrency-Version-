# Hello-World-Concurrency-Version-
Ouput "Hello World" using multiple (2) threads.

Reading through "C++ Concurrency In Action - Practical Multithreading" by Anthony Williams.
Finished Ch.1 so far.

Using the "thread" library of C++ this program makes a simple, yet unnecessary, two threaded [process?processes] where the initial thread
is the "main" function, and the second is initialized by the "hello" function. 
It also uses the join method to pause the main thread in order to finish the hello thread.
